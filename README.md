# CryptoClustering
Data Analytics Bootcamp: Module 19 Challenge

## Project Description
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Instructions
* Prepare the data using the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file
* Find the best value for k using the original scaled dataframe using the elbow method
* Cluster the cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the best value for k using the PCA data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data
